# Ronny Wang Meeting Preparation Guide
**CDC / Grown Brilliance SOW Discussion**

---

## Meeting Objectives
1. Preview SOW contents and get alignment before formal submission
2. Confirm $35k budget fits within her signing authority
3. Understand success metrics from her perspective
4. Position collaboration with Anik (new data warehouse hire)
5. Create urgency without being pushy

---

## Key Value Messages

### 30-Second Elevator Pitch
*"Ronny, you've acquired a million-dollar data asset that transformed Clean Origin from drowning in data to doubling regional sales. For $35k - just 3.5% of what they invested - we'll unlock that value for Grown Brilliance, starting with extracting your critical sales data and optimizing your AWS costs by at least 30%."*

### The Three Pillars
1. **Protect Your Investment**: $1M+ already spent (not just the $630k to CDC)
2. **Proven Results**: System that doubled sales still works perfectly
3. **Immediate Value**: Data extraction + AWS savings pays for itself

---

## Conversation Starters

### Opening
*"Before we dive into the SOW details, I wanted to share something remarkable - your Clean Origin system ran perfectly for over 7 months without any intervention from us. It only stopped when the credit card expired. That's the level of reliability you've acquired."*

### Creating Urgency (Soft Approach)
*"Two quick concerns: First, Snowflake has data retention policies that could affect older data. Second, every month you're paying for AWS resources you might not need. We typically find 30-50% waste in these situations."*

### Anik Collaboration
*"I understand you have Anik joining the team with data warehouse experience. We'd love to ensure he has everything he needs to succeed - full documentation, knowledge transfer sessions, and direct access to the architects who built this system."*

---

## Power Statistics to Use

### ROI Metrics from Clean Origin
- **"Drowning to Thriving"**: Jeb's exact words about their transformation
- **100% Sales Increase**: First store doubled regional sales  
- **52,000 SKUs**: Daily pricing decisions on this massive catalog
- **"Almost Nothing"**: Customer acquisition cost for repeat buyers
- **7+ Months**: System ran unattended (Feb-Sept 2024)
- **6 Successful Stores**: Expansion guided by data insights

### Your Unique Value
- **4+ Years**: Deep jewelry industry expertise
- **19 Snowflake Implementations**: Proven expertise
- **$162.50 â†’ $275**: Your rates were way below market
- **"Tremendous"**: Jeb's assessment of CDC's work
- **Original Architects**: Zero learning curve needed

## Handling Potential Objections

### "We're not ready for a full data warehouse"
*"Absolutely, that's why this SOW focuses only on what you need today - getting your data out and cutting AWS costs. The beauty is, once you see what's in there, you'll know if future investment makes sense."*

### "Why not let Anik handle this?"
*"Anik is probably fantastic, but even the best data engineer would need 3-6 months to understand what we built over 4 years. Plus, the Magento transformations alone took us months to perfect. We can have Anik shadow us and transfer all that knowledge."*

### "$35k seems like a lot for data extraction"
*"Let me reframe that - Clean Origin paid us $630k at below-market rates, plus their internal costs pushed the investment over $1 million. You're paying 3.5% to unlock 100% of the value. Plus, the AWS savings alone will likely cover 30-50% of this cost."*

### "We use Power BI, not Looker"
*"Perfect - we've actually become Power BI experts. Our largest client, Aubuchon Hardware, uses Power BI across 130+ stores. We'll optimize the data export specifically for Power BI integration."*

---

## Questions to Ask Ronny

### Success Metrics
- *"What would make this a huge win for you personally?"*
- *"How are you measuring success in your Director of Operations role?"*
- *"What's the most painful data-related task you're doing manually today?"*

### Decision Process
- *"Is $35k within your signing authority, or who else needs to review?"*
- *"What concerns might Tejas (CEO) have that we should address?"*
- *"Any internal politics or sensitivities we should be aware of?"*

### Technical Integration
- *"How can we best position this work to support Anik's success?"*
- *"Is Chris (analytics lead) supportive of external help?"*
- *"What Power BI reports are most critical to the business today?"*

### Timeline
- *"Any specific deadlines driving data needs?"*
- *"When would you ideally want this work completed?"*
- *"Any budget cycles we should be aware of?"*

## Visual Aids to Reference

### The ZIP Code Story
*"Imagine a heat map of the entire US showing exactly where your highest-value customers live. That's not a mockup - that's the actual Looker dashboard Clean Origin used to decide where to open stores. The Dallas store they opened based on this data doubled their regional sales."*

### The Magento Complexity
*"Magento's data structure is like a spider web - beautiful but impossible to navigate. We spent months mapping those 52,000 SKUs so each one had accurate margin data. That intellectual property is now yours."*

### The Daily Operations Impact
*"Jeb told us they used the system every single day for pricing decisions. It went from a nice-to-have to mission-critical. That's the system you now own."*

---

## Closing Strategies

### Soft Close
*"Based on what we've discussed, does the $35k investment make sense given the value you'd be unlocking? What questions can I answer to help you feel confident moving forward?"*

### Urgency Close
*"I'm concerned about two things: data retention policies and ongoing AWS waste. Every month we delay costs money and risks data loss. Could we start the credential verification next week while you review the SOW internally?"*

### Partnership Close
*"We see this as the beginning of a partnership. This initial project proves our value at low risk. Once you see what's in the data, you'll know exactly what future investments make sense. Fair enough?"*

## Key Documents to Reference

1. **Master Services Agreement** - Already signed with Tom
2. **SOW #001** - The document we're discussing
3. **Jeb Beckwith Testimonial** - Powerful CFO endorsement
4. **Case Study** - Technical details if needed

---

## Budget Conversation

### Payment Structure
- **$15k Initial Retainer** - Starts work immediately
- **$10k at Data Delivery** - Week 3 milestone  
- **$10k at Completion** - Week 6 final delivery

### Why Retainer Model
*"Since your contract team removed late payment penalties, the retainer structure protects our cash flow while giving you maximum flexibility."*

### Value Perspective
- Hourly: 140 hours @ $250 blended = $35k
- Compare: Market rate would be $45-50k
- ROI: Protecting $1M investment + AWS savings

---

## Political Considerations

### People to Keep Happy
- **Ronny**: Make her look brilliant for protecting assets
- **Anik**: Position as empowering, not threatening
- **Chris**: Respect his Power BI expertise
- **Tejas (CEO)**: ROI and strategic value focus

### Internal Dynamics
- No CTO/CDO = Less technical resistance
- Tom's departure = Need new champion (Ronny)
- Power BI preference = Respect existing choices
- Cost consciousness = Emphasize ROI/savings
