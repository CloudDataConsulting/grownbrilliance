        <instructions>
            <instruction id="1">
                Extract only the work directly requested by Ronny Wang and the team - do not oversell or add services they haven't asked for, as they are not yet sold on a full data warehouse solution.
            </instruction>
            <instruction id="2">
                Focus on the immediate pain points: data extraction from Snowflake (Clean Origin system), AWS cost analysis/cleanup, and supporting their current Power BI setup.
            </instruction>
            <instruction id="3">
                Position the work as a retainer-based engagement for cash flow purposes and because late payment penalties were removed from the contract.
            </instruction>
            <instruction id="4">
                Include an overview/assessment of the existing Clean Origin Snowflake system as part of the deliverables to showcase capabilities and set up future opportunities.
            </instruction>
            <instruction id="5">
                Keep in mind key stakeholders: Ronny Wang (Director of Operations, reports to CEO), Chris (analytics lead), and potentially CEO Tejas Shah for review.
            </instruction>
            <instruction id="6">
                Reference the $630k investment already made in the Clean Origin system and position this as protecting/leveraging existing assets.
            </instruction>
            <instruction id="7">
                Acknowledge their current tech stack preferences (Power BI over Looker) and work within their constraints.
            </instruction>
            <instruction id="8">
                Structure pricing and timeline for immediate deliverables while leaving door open for future data warehouse modernization discussions.

                CDC built and managed Clean Origin's complete data reporting system on Snowflake using Fivetran, dbt, and Looker over 3-4 years for approximately $630,000. Grown Brilliance purchased Clean Origin's assets in 2024 and initially kept the system running to report on Clean Origin data separately. They have now shut down most of the system but need help extracting data and managing AWS costs while determining what to keep versus what to discontinue.

                Key challenges: Grown Brilliance uses Power BI (not Looker), has limited data warehouse knowledge, no CTO/CDO/CIO (Chris handles all data), and needs to integrate Clean Origin customer data with their existing brands for unified customer experience. They removed late payment penalties from the contract, making retainer structure important for cash flow.

                Current pain points: Manual data processing, difficulty accessing specific data in Snowflake, AWS cost management, need for sales history and customer data extraction for integration into their systems.
