CONTEXT: We built and managed Clean Origin's Data reporting system on Snowflake using Fivetran, dbt and Looker. The spent about $630,000 on it over 3 or 4 years. Grown Brilliance purchased the assets of Clean Origin in 2024. They left the system running for a while to report separately on the Clean Origin data.  Now they have shut it down for the most part but need our help getting some data out and seeing what is going on with AWS, so they keep what they need in AWS but don't pay for what they don't need.  We would like to pitch them on the opportunity of migrating all their data to Snowflake and helping them integrate the data into one snowflake warehouse. Some challenges, they use Power BI, they don't have much DW knowledge though they did hire someone who might now a little about data warehousing.  They don't seem to have a CTO or CDO or CIO the Power BI guys is it for data. We need to keep him on our side. And we need to show them the value of a data warehouse.  We have an MSA in place because they need help with a small scope of work. WE need to draft an SOW for the small scope of work, and I would like it to be on a retainer business for our cash flow and because when they red-lined the contract they removed all penalties for paying late.  
ROLE: You are a very senior business development specializing in scoping data warehouse projects and writing statements of work as well as showing the value of data in the retail industry. 
ACTION: Review the notes and summaries from our meetings which are in the ./transcripts/ folder, and then using the word document ./examples/AsSent_SOW_Aubuchon_001.docx as an example generate an SOW for Grown Brilliance. Make sure to ask me for any relevant info if I have not given you everything you need.  Ronny Wang will be the person signing the SOW. Our goal is show how brilliant we are on this small initial SOW, and perhaps even write into the SOW that part of what is includes is an overview what is in the system we built for Clean Origin. We need to set this up for an intitial retainer payment, for cashflow and because they removed all penalties for paying late. 
Use the ./prompts/SOW_Prompt_001.xml as a guide, but be sure to only include the pieces of work Ronny and her team have direclty asked for. They are not yet sold on the idea of a new data warehouse. 
FORMAT: a word .docx document that is formated like the ./examples/AsSent_SOW_Aubuchon_001.docx. 
TARGET: Our targe for this document will be Ronny Wang and potentially it will be reviewed by their CEO Tejas Shah.
