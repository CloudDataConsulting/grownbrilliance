        <reasoning_guidance>
            Think step-by-step through each section of the transcription. For each speaker's contribution, consider:
            1. What specific business need or requirement are they expressing?
            2. What level of detail and specificity have they provided?
            3. Are there implicit requirements or assumptions that need to be made explicit?
            4. How does this information relate to other requirements or constraints mentioned?
            5. What questions or clarifications would a project manager or legal team need?
            
            When analyzing requirements, reason through:
            - The difference between stated needs and underlying business objectives
            - Technical feasibility and resource implications of each requirement
            - Potential conflicts or dependencies between different requirements
            - Missing information that would be critical for accurate scoping and pricing
            
            For timeline and resource analysis, consider:
            - Realistic effort estimates based on the complexity described
            - Resource availability and skill matching requirements
            - Critical path dependencies and potential bottlenecks
            - Buffer time needs for testing, reviews, and revisions
