# **Unlocking Success at Clean Origin: Interview with Former CFO Jeb Beckwith**

**Mike Watson:** Hi everyone. Thanks for joining. This is Mike Watson with Cloud Data Consulting. I'm here today with Jeb Beckwith, former CFO at Clean Origin. Clean Origin is a client of Cloud Data Consulting, and they were acquired earlier this year, but we wanted to talk with Jeb a little bit about the project and some of the business results we got out of it.

This slide has a case study already linked for the Clean Origin story. It's more about the technologies and tools involved. I'll show you what it looks like real quick and you can go look at this on your own. But again, it's more of a CTO background on, the various technologies and tools we used.

We're gonna focus more on the business aspects of the project and the results we got. So Clean Origin is a company founded in 2017 that provided lab grown diamonds in an environmentally responsible and ethically driven way. So that's the business that they were in. And I'm here with Jeb.

Jeb, I'm totally curious to hear about your background and career roles before you came to over to Clean Origin, and I'd love to hear that to start off with. 

**Jeb Beckwith:** Sure. I'm a reform banker. Been in banking since the 1980s. My last stint was at in banking, was at Royal Bank in Canada, where I looked after global financial institutions through and then after the financial crisis.

Very familiar with data, how important data is to all sorts of different businesses. I came to Clean Origin after making an investment. I knew the CEO the CEO. Needed some financial help. And the first thing I did was when I came to Clean Origin, I said you gotta you've got a operation here with 52,000 SKUs.

Each one of those SKUs is gonna have a different gross margin that you have to attribute to that. We need to have a way that we're gonna have marketing associated with each one of those. And we've gotta get better about. Our data our data integrity, our data manipulation, and and so that's a little bit about my background at RBC.

**Mike Watson:** And so when you were at Clean Origin, how did you guys start to realize you might need some outside help to, wrangle some of the data and analytics challenges you faced? 

**Jeb Beckwith:** As I said, we. We were drowning and we knew we had a great product, right? We had this new product. Again, diamond rings have been around for a long time.

This is the first one where we have something that was truly unique in, in that it was manufactured. Diamond is exactly the same. Cut clarity color as anything else, chemically identical to mined diamonds. So we were really setting out to change the industry. And we did that actually since 2017\. The mined Diamond World has a percentage of total sales has gone from a hundred percent to now about probably less than 25% of total diamonds around the world.

But in order to get from here from where we were when I joined in 2021 to where we were when we just recently sold it again, if you think about. All the different kinds of kara sizes that you can have in a diamond. Every diamond is unique. So we have different cuts, different clarity.

You can have an oval, you can have an emerald cut, you could have a two kara. You can have a 1.5 carat, you can have a five carat diamond. The different settings some settings will hold. Bigger diamonds, some settings will hold smaller diamonds. So the combinations of all those kinds of things were created a very complex kind of selling process.

And originally we were all online. Eventually we opened up six physical stores to compliment the online business and created an omnichannel environment. But it created a very complex kind of data gathering kind, not only the data gathering, but data evaluation. Process for us. So we needed, we knew that we, if we were gonna optimize this business and compete with some of the big boys and really change the industry, we knew we needed to have data that, that gave us the tools so that we could price our products appropriately, price our costs appropriately.

Look at those, look at the taxes, and and then determine. On a trial and error basis and the a, b, C basis, where are how much wiggle room we had in terms of increasing prices versus different costs where we, where our marketing dollars were gonna be best spent which areas in the country were the best for us.

Breaking down by geography, breaking down to a zip code level, breaking down. By type of sale, whether it's a bridal sale or we also had fashion sales breaking it down also by customer attribution. 

**Mike Watson:** Anything that stood out as far as what you learned about the data in terms of, comparing it in the e-commerce world that you were, tracking it in, and then thinking about the physical world where you were analyzing the idea of opening stores.

**Jeb Beckwith:** Sure. So we, 

Again, originally we were just, we were purely online, but until we got that data warehouse up and running, we really didn't have a good, we just had an anecdotal sense. We didn't have a tangible sense. We really needed to get serious about omnichannel. When we opened up our first store, we opened that in Dallas, in the middle of COVID, and we did it because it was an experiment.

We, we had heard from other. Retailers that Omnichannel was, had some legs to it, and we wanted to explore that. In the middle of COVID, we had a brand new mall in the northern place called Frisco in the northern part of the Dallas Metroplex. That that really needed somebody in center court. The diamond business was a particularly good fit for that area because.

It has a, it brings, because we had the online business, we were bringing customers into the mall as opposed to sucking traffic out of the mall. So the mall liked that. The way we looked at that is we said, okay, so here's our sales and our sales growth over time for the whole universe in the United States.

Here's, and we broke it down by zip codes. Here's where that sales growth. As a percentage of total sales is within that Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex area. And we got granular, less granular, more granular. So we looked at it a couple different ways. And then because we were a fast growing company, we wanted to look at this on a percentage of sales basis and not an absolute dollar basis.

Then when we put the store in. We looked to see so here's what we're doing in our four walls. Here's what we're doing in the geographic region without the store, and what additive sales are we gaining from that from that store being in process. And we found early on that we were basically doubling the sales in that region that we otherwise would've had.

And so if you think about doubling the sales. At the time we were running at about a 50%, maybe a little bit less gross margin on a blended basis. So that more than covered the costs of of opening up that, that extra store. And if you look at the traffic that we got from adding up that, from adding that extra store, and the reduction in marketing costs that we had.

Because we had that store basically as an extra marketing venue for us. It worked out really well. 

**Mike Watson:** And did that led you to consider additional stores then? 

**Jeb Beckwith:** Yeah. The, so the stores the first store in Dallas was a real success. And and so we we took that model. And we extended the first sell store for for extended lease.

We opened up another five stores in different kinds of markets because we wanted to do some experimentation of to do more experiment to find out really more where our client was selling was being driven to on a physical basis. So we opened up a small store in. In the Eastern Mall in outside of Cincinnati, which is a destination mall.

We opened up a mall in the Tysons Mall outside of DC which was a fantastic place. We opened up a one in very high end, we open up another store in the Woodlands. It both in the Woodlands and Woodfield. So Woodfield Mall is in, outside of Chicago and Schaumburg. Again, very high end terrific store, mall.

And then in Houston we had two stores, one in Baybrook, which a large store in a more of a working class area and then Woodlands. So we had a number of different kinds of stores and different kinds of geographies. The, and in each case though, we were looking for, what's the upsell, what's the omnichannel benefit from that?

So you take the costs of running the store plus the sales, and you take the cost of direct marketing into that area plus the sales. And what's your incremental sales on top of all that that you're getting from adding those stores. 

**Mike Watson:** And did the additional openings bring the same level of what you would, what you called success with the Dallas store or were they a mixed bag?

**Jeb Beckwith:** I'd say there were some, like anything else, you open six stores. All very different. Some are very different than others. We found, what we learned was that our customer base was. Generally higher end, not highest then. So we weren't competing with Tiffany so much, but but certainly, I'd say upper quartille so second quartile kind of customer in terms of income level.

We were getting a lot of. Second and third kind of kind of clients and some very, and we ended up, especially in our higher end stores and Tysons and Woodfield, we got a lot of shopping by her for her. She would come in and she would see this beautiful ring. So it wasn't so much, a traditional bridal engagement business was.

Probably 85% of the navigating on the site was done by her, and probably 90% of the shopping is done by him on your traditional bridal business. And that's why it was really important for that customer lifetime value for us to take that initial bridal sale and translate that into an anniversary gift.

A wedding gift, a birthday gift or just a gift for yourself and the customer. Lifetime value becomes critically important for a company like ours because you know that marketing, the biggest cost of our customer acquisition is in that upfront marketing, getting that customer that doesn't know us or doesn't even know what lab grown diamond is to come onto our platform.

If we can get that customer into our database, comfortable with us, comfortable with our client service and our product, then the customer acquisition cost goes down to almost nothing. 

**Mike Watson:** So thinking about the, the project, the, the work that Cloud Data Consulting did for Clean Origin, were you always able to get the.

Very specific financial like reporting and analytics that you needed on things like gross margin, gross sales even a BA given that you had a lot of sales, promotions, discounts, taxes, it's complicated as all can be. You have a ton of data and you're dealing with omnichannel complications.

So my question really is are were you able to get like the specific analytics that you needed from the data that we ended up prepping from the data source through the ETL to the Snowflake data warehouse, et cetera? So I would say Looker, I should mention Looker that we use for analytics, right? 

**Jeb Beckwith:** So I would say that without, and before we had. Getting from A to B took a lot because we had to get the mapping that was involved because we're pricing each individual product separately. And we were getting our input through originally online through Magento and then later through a POS.

So we had to mapping all that in into Snowflake and then through the five TRA ETL that we were using to get to Looker. Getting that mapping right, took a lot of work. And I would say the Cloud Data Consulting was tremendous in that we wouldn't have been able to do it without you. But once we got there up and running being able to look down into an individual sale or an individual group of sales and to be able to look at geography or type of customer or what's her activity versus his activity?

Being able to do to look at the gross sales. Before discounts and returns net sales after returns. Look at our gross profit and gross margins for each one of the sales. Being able to look at and then being able to overlay. On top of that. Of course, our biggest cost be after grow, after our cost of consult was our marketing costs.

So being able to target that marketing, do those marketing dollars against our. Highest gross margin products and gross profit products gave us an ability to really tailor our marketing dollars against where we're gonna see the biggest bang for the buck. Getting back to what you called EBITDA or or what I'd call marketing, operating profit at, that the data that we were able to get through.

To pull into Looker and be able to and be able to show that as opposed to doing a bunch of SQL in queries through the Snowflake database was something we used every single day and enable us to do to look at trends and to do pricing and repricing every single day.

**Mike Watson:** What tools were really like, the ones that stood out in terms of how you felt about 'em in terms of easy use effectiveness, just 'cause we're partners with all of 'em. So I'm just curious to your feedback from your standpoint as a CFO versus the tech people. 

**Jeb Beckwith:** For the most part we were using, we were look using looker every day.

So I certainly realized that getting getting those Looker reports from Snowflake, I didn't have day-to-day interaction with Snowflake. I didn't, I certainly knew how it worked. I didn't have day-to-day interaction with Fivetran. I knew how it worked. Looker we used every single day and we would create ad hoc reports.

Occasionally we'd do an SQL. Query directly into Snowflake, but but Looker we used every single day. 

**Mike Watson:** How did, how'd you feel overall about the Cloud Data Consulting team and the work we were doing there? 

**Jeb Beckwith:** Terrific. We would have once it was up and running, we would have occasional issues.

There were always refinements that we were looking at and doing. We would have occasional issues where. Something would break. And an example would be, we'd have a diamond feed that was coming from some vendors and the diamond feed would change, and that would break some of the mapping.

So when that happened we would, you guys would be on it. We'd see it pretty quickly and we'd flag it and we'd have it corrected within a very short amount of time. So I think, once it was up and running it really worked pretty well. Maintenance on it was really low.

The usefulness of it was very good. And we could create, our own our own queries, really pretty easily. So you guys were terrific. Any thoughts on and also very flexible too oh so if I needed to call you or Andy, for something specific, we could do that.

We used Jira to. To make sure that we had everybody's priorities aligned in the right ways and that all worked out really well. 

**Mike Watson:** Oh, cool. Yeah, I appreciate you mentioning Jira. 'cause I, I think about the big tools we use DBT, Matillion, snowflake on the data side and Looker around analytics.

But, I think about the fact that, we use, we leveraged Jira I believe Slack was involved as far as a communication outlet. Sure. Those kinds of things, being able to, incorporate all of that into, not just the project guts, but communication with us, the consulting firm.

I think that's critical stuff that we, make use of all the best communication because as a consulting firm, we're trying to be as transparent as possible. So you know what we delivered when we delivered it, and then you get the results in hand. Yeah. Yeah.

**Jeb Beckwith:** I think of Jira and Slack and all the Microsoft products.

I think that's table stakes. 

**Mike Watson:** Anything else about the, project that you recall that you'd want to, bring up in this conversation? 

**Jeb Beckwith:** Just that you guys were terrific to work with. Very flexible I think reasonable in terms of cost. There was a lot of heavy lifting that we had, I saw you in the heavy lifting side and at the front end and the more maintenance side at the back end.

So you guys were very good to work, 

work with. 

**Mike Watson:** We appreciate that very much. I wanna lead people with what's next for you job? Are you you're working currently in your own consulting business. Is that right?

**Jeb Beckwith:** Yeah, that's right. We're just starting off, but we got, we put together a great team.

What I wanna do is take the success that we've had and then we experienced it at Clean Origin and bring that to other small and medium sized businesses that are either, growing very rapidly or. Or looking at costs as a relatively small company, we're dealing with multiple different applications.

So you have all of these different things that you need to think about and somehow integrate. We wanna take all of that administration that you, that every company has to deal with, whether it's, you're keeping track of all your legal documents. Your incorporation documents, your cap table documents and your financial reporting, your HR reporting and pullout into something that makes sense for your business that's more economical than what you could do on your own and allow you to focus on the business that's really important to you.

So that's what we're doing. It's a business called Cooper Beckwith. 

**Mike Watson:** Yeah, sounds good. I just wanted to flash up our contact info one more time. So the Gmail here is fine for people wanna ask about your financial consulting work business and they can connect. Yes. I can also 

**Jeb Beckwith:** be reached at jeb@cooperbeckwith.com.

**Mike Watson:** Okay. jeb@cooperbeckwith.com and then this Gmail. Then, obviously you could, they can find you on LinkedIn or through us at Cloud Data Consulting. We're easy to find. I'm super easy to find. My phone number's been on the worldwide web for about 25 years I'll take the screen down here real quick to sign off, but appreciate that.

That was great to hear about your business. Sounds great role for you to lead that in the, in light of all the combination of both financial acumen that you have from all the experience, but also being really systems aware, knowing the IT side and being able to know how to leverage it for your financial needs and for the needs of the business in general.

And I, that's a great combination for helping clients in whatever their business happens to be while. Not worrying about the finance stuff. 'cause as like a lot of us don't want to know about details of finance, but, some people don't want to know the details of it. Just that's our business so 

**Jeb Beckwith:** well.

That's exactly right. And people most entrepreneurs I've found and almost 40 years of banking most entrepreneurs wanna focus on their business. They don't wanna know about finance. Finance or hr. Until it's the end of the month. Or then they wanna know, what did, how much money did I make and how where's all the cash, 

**Mike Watson:** all the stuff we're doing?

**Jeb Beckwith:** Yeah. How can I how can I invest it to make my business more profitable? So they wanna know the answers. They don't necessarily wanna get involved in the cooking. That's what we're here for. 

**Mike Watson:** That sounds great. I really appreciate all your time today. I'm, I think this has been a great conversation and I learned a heck of a lot myself that I didn't already know about, the things that we had done because a lot of that took place a few years ago.

But, I'm really thrilled to hear about. Your new options in that, going through this story with Clean Origin has been a really interesting process for you. So thank you so much for taking the time to capture some of this with us. We'll have this video up and people can, dig in deep and ask questions if they have any on, by reaching out to us.

But again, thanks a lot, Jeb. This has been amazing and I, can't wait to hear more from you down the road.
